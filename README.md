# react-redux-billing-emailer-demo

Exercise files as part of a course on Udemy, my repo version of it is unlicensed and I don't recommend for re-use as I will not be maintaining this app and am still researching its security. You can find the course on Udemy searching Node with React: Fullstack Web Development by Stephen Grider. I am simply building this along with the course in order to gain new understandings working with certain portions of react and redux as a single MERN web app.

## App Concept

The overall app concept is a very basic implementation of a profile and credit based campaign emailer app that allows users to login, purchase credits and use the credits to manage email campaigns that aggregates polls to our clients users.
