# react-redux-billing-emailer-demo
Exercise files as part of a course on Udemy, my repo version of it is unlicensed and I don't recommend for re-use as I will not be maintaining this app. You can find the course on Udemy searching Node with React: Fullstack Web Development by Stephen Grider.  I am simply building this along with the course in order to gain new understandings working with certain portions of react and redux as a single MERN web app.     

## App Concept
The overall app concept is a very basic implementation of a profile and credit based campaign emailer app that allows users to login, purchase credits and use the credits to manage email campaigns that aggregates polls to our clients users. 

## The stack
-Full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js, & Node.js)
-Redux
-Stripe Billing Integration
-Mongoose
-Passport.js
-Google oAuth 2.0

## App Status
This is being developed currently.
