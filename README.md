Exercise files as part of a course on Udemy, my repo version of it is unlicensed and I don't recommend for re-use as I will not be maintaining this app. You can find the course on Udemy searching Node with React: Fullstack Web Development by Stephen Grider.  I am simply building this along with the course in order to gain new understandings working with certain portions of react and redux as a single MERN web app.
